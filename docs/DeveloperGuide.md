### Architecture

<img src="images/ArchitectureDiagram.png" width="280" />

The **_Architecture Diagram_** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** (consisting of classes [`Main`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java)) is in charge of the app launch and shut down.

- At app launch, it initializes the other components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
- At shut down, it shuts down the other components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

The bulk of the app's work is done by the following four components:

- [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
- [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
- [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
- [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The _Sequence Diagram_ below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

<img src="images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

- defines its _API_ in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
- implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<img src="images/ComponentManagers.png" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

![Structure of the UI Component](images/UiClassDiagram.png)

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

- executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
- listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
- keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
- depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Person` object residing in the `Model`.

### Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<img src="images/LogicClassDiagram.png" width="550"/>

The sequence diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component, taking `execute("delete 1")` API call as an example.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command](images/DeleteSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline continues till the end of diagram.
</div>

How the `Logic` component works:

1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it is passed to an `AddressBookParser` object which in turn creates a parser that matches the command (e.g., `DeleteCommandParser`) and uses it to parse the command.
1. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `DeleteCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to delete a person).<br>
   Note that although this is shown as a single step in the diagram above (for simplicity), in the code it can take several interactions (between the command object and the `Model`) to achieve.
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<img src="images/ParserClasses.png" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:

- When called upon to parse a user command, the `AddressBookParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddCommand`) which the `AddressBookParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
- All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddCommandParser`, `DeleteCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

### Model component

**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

<img src="images/ModelClassDiagram.png" width="450" />

The `Model` component,

- stores the address book data i.e., all `Person`, `Group` and `GroupMemberDetails` objects (which are contained in a `UniquePersonList` and `UniqueGroupList` object).
- stores the currently 'selected' `Person` or `Group` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
- stores a `UserPref` object that represents the userâ€™s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
- does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** An alternative (arguably, a more OOP) model is given below. It has a `Tag` list in the `AddressBook`, which `Person` references. This allows `AddressBook` to only require one `Tag` object per unique tag, instead of each `Person` needing their own `Tag` objects.<br>

<img src="images/BetterModelClassDiagram.png" width="450" />

</div>

- `Group` class contains an `ArrayListMap` object which acts similarly to a Map
- The `Person` objects are stored in the `Group` object as 'keys' of the `ArrayListMap` within `Group` object
- The values of the `ArrayListMap` would be the corresponding `GroupMemberDetail` object

<img src = "images/PersonInGroupDiagram.png" width="450" />

### Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

<img src="images/StorageClassDiagram.png" width="550" />

The `Storage` component is responsible for persisting address book data and user preferences to the hard disk. It handles the conversion between in-memory objects and their file representations.

#### Structure

The Storage component is organized into two main areas:

1. **AddressBook Storage**: Manages the reading and writing of address book data

   - `AddressBookStorage` interface defines the operations
   - `JsonAddressBookStorage` provides JSON-based implementation
   - Uses `JsonSerializableAddressBook` as an intermediate representation
   - Contains a hierarchy of JSON adapter classes that mirror the model structure:
     - `JsonAdaptedGroup` represents groups in the address book
     - `JsonAdaptedGroupMemberDetails` contains details about group membership
     - `JsonAdaptedPerson` and `JsonAdaptedAssignment` linked to group member details
     - `JsonAdaptedTag` represents tags associated with persons

2. **UserPrefs Storage**: Manages the reading and writing of user preferences
   - `UserPrefsStorage` interface defines the operations
   - `JsonUserPrefsStorage` provides JSON-based implementation

The `Storage` interface extends both `AddressBookStorage` and `UserPrefsStorage`, providing a unified API. `StorageManager` implements this interface and coordinates between both storage types.

#### Key Operations

**Reading Data**:

- Retrieves data via file paths specified in the storage implementations
- Converts JSON data to model objects through the adapter class hierarchy
- Returns `Optional` objects to handle cases where files don't exist
- Throws `DataLoadingException` when data cannot be loaded properly

**Writing Data**:

- Accepts model objects and converts them to JSON format using adapter classes
- Writes to specified file paths
- Throws `IOException` when writing fails
- Logs operations for debugging purposes

#### Design Considerations

- **Interface Segregation**: Separate interfaces allow for independent implementation and testing of different storage aspects
- **Adapter Pattern**: JSON adapter classes separate model concerns from persistence details
- **Complex Composition**: The JSON classes mirror the complex relationships in the model, including groups, group memberships, persons, assignments, and tags
- **Dependency Injection**: `StorageManager` takes concrete storage implementations as constructor parameters, facilitating testing and flexibility

This design provides clean separation of concerns, allowing the model to remain focused on business logic while the storage component handles persistence details. The hierarchy of JSON adapter classes supports the address book's ability to manage not just persons and tags, but also groups, group memberships, and assignments.

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.address.commons` package.

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### Adding a person to a group

The sequence diagram below illustrate the process of adding a Person to a Group by writing the command `add-to-group n/ p g/ g`.

1. First the command will go through the standard logic sequence. Creating a Unique Command parser to parse input data to create
   a `AddPersonToGroupCommand` object
2. The `LogicManger` then execute the command by calling `execute(m)
3. `AddPersonToGroupCommand` will get the `Person` object to be added and the `Group` object to be added to from `Model`
4. Lastly, the `addPersonToGroup` method will be called to add the `Person` object into the `Group` object.
5. A `CommandResult` is returned for `Ui` purpose

![AddPersonToGroupSequenceDiagram-Logic](images/AddPersonToGroupSequenceDiagram-Logic.png)

The `Group` object will create a new `GroupMemberDetail` object tied to the newly added `Person` object and stored into the Map as a key-value pair. 6. After `addPersonToGroup` is called, the `Model` will call on the `VersionedAddressBook` to which adds `p:Person` to `g:Group` 7. `Group` will create a new `GroupMemberDetails` object that corresponds to `p:Person` object 8. Both the `p:Person` and the newly created `GroupMemberDetails` objects will be stored in an `ArrayListMap` within the `Group` object

![AddPersonToGroupSequenceDiagram-Model](images/AddPersonToGroupSequenceDiagram-Model.png)

### Adding a new assignment

The sequence diagram below illustrates the process of adding an Assignment to a Group using the command `add-assignment n/a g/g d/d`.

1. As with all commands, the command will go through the standard logic sequence. A unique command parser is created to parse the input data and construct an `AddAssignmentCommand` object.
2. The `LogicManager` then executes the command by calling `execute(m)`
3. The `AddAssignmentCommand` retrieves the target `Group` object from the `Model`
4. The `Model`'s `addAssignmentToGroup` method is called with the necessary parameters.
5. A `CommandResult` is returned for `Ui` purposes.

![AddAssignmentSequenceDiagram-Logic](images/AddAssignmentSequenceDiagram-Logic.png)

Inside the `Group` object, the `Assignment` constructor is called to create a new `Assignment` object using the parsed name and deadline. The new `Assignment` object is then added to the assignments `ArrayList` field of the `Group` object.

![AddAssignmentSequenceDiagram-Model](images/AddAssignmentSequenceDiagram-Model.png)

### \[Proposed\] Undo/redo feature

#### Proposed Implementation

The proposed undo/redo mechanism is facilitated by `VersionedAddressBook`. It extends `AddressBook` with an undo/redo history, stored internally as an `addressBookStateList` and `currentStatePointer`. Additionally, it implements the following operations:

- `VersionedAddressBook#commit()`â€‰â€”â€‰Saves the current address book state in its history.
- `VersionedAddressBook#undo()`â€‰â€”â€‰Restores the previous address book state from its history.
- `VersionedAddressBook#redo()`â€‰â€”â€‰Restores a previously undone address book state from its history.

These operations are exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#commitAddressBook()`, `Model#undoAddressBook()` and `Model#redoAddressBook()` respectively.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the undo/redo mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `VersionedAddressBook` will be initialized with the initial address book state, and the `currentStatePointer` pointing to that single address book state.

![UndoRedoState0](images/UndoRedoState0.png)

Step 2. The user executes `delete 5` command to delete the 5th person in the address book. The `delete` command calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`, causing the modified state of the address book after the `delete 5` command executes to be saved in the `addressBookStateList`, and the `currentStatePointer` is shifted to the newly inserted address book state.

![UndoRedoState1](images/UndoRedoState1.png)

Step 3. The user executes `add n/David â€¦â€‹` to add a new person. The `add` command also calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`, causing another modified address book state to be saved into the `addressBookStateList`.

![UndoRedoState2](images/UndoRedoState2.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If a command fails its execution, it will not call `Model#commitAddressBook()`, so the address book state will not be saved into the `addressBookStateList`.

</div>

Step 4. The user now decides that adding the person was a mistake, and decides to undo that action by executing the `undo` command. The `undo` command will call `Model#undoAddressBook()`, which will shift the `currentStatePointer` once to the left, pointing it to the previous address book state, and restores the address book to that state.

![UndoRedoState3](images/UndoRedoState3.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If the `currentStatePointer` is at index 0, pointing to the initial AddressBook state, then there are no previous AddressBook states to restore. The `undo` command uses `Model#canUndoAddressBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather
than attempting to perform the undo.

</div>

The following sequence diagram shows how an undo operation goes through the `Logic` component:

![UndoSequenceDiagram](images/UndoSequenceDiagram-Logic.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `UndoCommand` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

</div>

Similarly, how an undo operation goes through the `Model` component is shown below:

![UndoSequenceDiagram](images/UndoSequenceDiagram-Model.png)

The `redo` command does the oppositeâ€‰â€”â€‰it calls `Model#redoAddressBook()`, which shifts the `currentStatePointer` once to the right, pointing to the previously undone state, and restores the address book to that state.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If the `currentStatePointer` is at index `addressBookStateList.size() - 1`, pointing to the latest address book state, then there are no undone AddressBook states to restore. The `redo` command uses `Model#canRedoAddressBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the redo.

</div>

Step 5. The user then decides to execute the command `list`. Commands that do not modify the address book, such as `list`, will usually not call `Model#commitAddressBook()`, `Model#undoAddressBook()` or `Model#redoAddressBook()`. Thus, the `addressBookStateList` remains unchanged.

![UndoRedoState4](images/UndoRedoState4.png)

Step 6. The user executes `clear`, which calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`. Since the `currentStatePointer` is not pointing at the end of the `addressBookStateList`, all address book states after the `currentStatePointer` will be purged. Reason: It no longer makes sense to redo the `add n/David â€¦â€‹` command. This is the behavior that most modern desktop applications follow.

![UndoRedoState5](images/UndoRedoState5.png)

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new command:

<img src="images/CommitActivityDiagram.png" width="250" />

#### Design considerations:

**Aspect: How undo & redo executes:**

- **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves the entire address book.

  - Pros: Easy to implement.
  - Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.

- **Alternative 2:** Individual command knows how to undo/redo by
  itself.
  - Pros: Will use less memory (e.g. for `delete`, just save the person being deleted).
  - Cons: We must ensure that the implementation of each individual command are correct.

## **Appendix: Effort**

### Group and GroupMemberDetail

The project introduced a new object: `Group`, alongside a relational object `GroupMemberDetail` that describes students' details inside a particular group. This requires us to ensure that data is synchronized through the user workflow by making sure that our Maps and Lists point to the same object by reference. In particular, since `Person` is hashed by name, we had to take caution when allowing editing of name. To deal with this, we introduced 2 new data structures: `ArrayListSet` and `ArrayListMap`. These classes have the interface of `Set` and `Map` respectively, but are internally stored in `ArrayList` objects so that editing the key objects does not change our key values. This is important since we use `Person` as a key for our Map of `GroupMemberDetail` and that `hashCode()` hashes `Person` based off its name.

The introduction of a relation object `GroupMemberDetail` also made it important for us to agree on a source of truth for synchronizing data. We decided to keep the relation data inside the `Group` data, while keeping a name of the person referenced, whose reference will be looked up during the data loading stage. This design relies on the assumption made by AB3, which was that 2 persons are equal if they have the same name (mentioned under the implementation of `Person::isSamePerson()`). Hence, `Person` data is stored as one list, and `Group` data is stored as another list (which contains `GroupMemberDetail` for each group member). Data is loaded by first reading and creating `Person` objects, followed by `Groups`. Each `GroupMemberDetail` will then associate the referenced name with a `Person` object that should exist. This allows us to ensure that the references are created and referenced properly.

### Reuse and Adaptation

- While the base `Person` and command structure were derived from AB3, at least **60â€“70%** of our implementation around Groups was written from scratch.
- Reuse was mainly in utility classes (e.g., `ToStringBuilder`, `AppUtil`) and storage design patterns.
- Our work in adapting the storage layer was influenced by the original `JsonSerializableAddressBook` class but extended heavily to handle nested structures.

### Summary

Implementing `Group` and `GroupMemberDetail` added substantial architectural and technical complexity, transforming the app from a simple JSON list data structure to one that required careful synchronization and development of new data structures to support our needs, requiring a significant portion of our effort.

## **Appendix: Planned Enhancements**

Team size: 5

### Submission and grading of assignments
Currently, the app allows TAs to add, delete and edit assignments, but there is no support for submission and grading of assignments. We plan to allow TAs to add and grade student submissions for assignments. TAs will also be able to add submission deadlines and set penalties for late submissions. Ultimately, the goal is for TAs to be able to create assignment deadlines, record down their students' time of submission, and grade students' work while also penalizing late submissions.

### Display of assignment data
Currently, assignments cannot be viewed as there is not much to be done with them without a grading feature. We plan to make them displayable together with the implementation of grading of assignments in the future so that the information is meaningful. This will be done via some sort of `list-assignments` command that will show what assignments are in the group, and for each student if they have submitted or not.

### Nicer UI and output of command feedback
Currently, shows JSON output which is informative and clear for a technically inclined person, but does not look as nice on the UI. Future plan is to enhance the output format to be more visually appealing alongside a UI visual upgrade to display both person and group lists side-by-side for better information tracking. We also intend to make the feedback window dynamically sized so that error messages fit within the box and users will not need to scroll through, thus reducing friction when inputting wrong commands.

### Support for TA and Lecturer roles
Currently, all persons in the application are assumed to be students which is most important to track for a TA. We plan to add support for TA and Professor roles which would facilitate the feature on grading and submission of assignments.

### Listing students in sorted name order
Currently, students in groups are indexed arbitrarily. For a future enhancement, we intend to list them in sorted name order for easier lookup.

### Marking the attendance of multiple students for multiple weeks at once
Currently, `mark-attendance` only allows the attendance of a single student and for a single week to be marked. This can be time-consuming when marking attendance for larger classes. To make the experience more efficient, we plan to allow TAs to mark multiple students' attendance for multiple weeks at once. The command would look like `mark-all-attendance g/GROUP w/WEEK1[,WEEK2,WEEK3,...] n/PERSON1 [n/PERSON2 n/PERSON3 ...]`.

### Display groups that students are in
When listing students currently, the list does not show which groups they are in. We plan to add this information in for this command so that tutors can see which group each student belongs to without going through all the groups he is in charge of.

### Precise validation for phone numbers
Currently, the app allows any string of digits with between 3 and 15 digits to be entered as a phone number.
We plan to add more precise validation to ensure that the phone number is in a valid format and length.
This will help prevent errors when trying to contact students.

### Support for more names
Currently, not all characters are supported in names, like Cyrillic characters and some combinations of slashes (i.e., `p/` and `g/`).
We plan to extend support for more names in the future.
