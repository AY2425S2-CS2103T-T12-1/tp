TAbby Dabby is a **desktop app designed for teaching assistants, optimized for use via a Command Line Interface** (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, it can get your administrative tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps.

It is named TAbby Dabby because it rolls off the tongue and is designed to assist TAs (i.e., Teaching Assistants) with their administrative work.

For the detailed documentation of this project, see the [TAbby Dabby Product Website](https://ay2425s2-cs2103t-t12-1.github.io/).

This project is based on the AddressBook-Level3 project created by the [SE-EDU initiative](https://se-education.org).
