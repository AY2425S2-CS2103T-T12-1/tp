- This is **a sample project for Software Engineering (SE) students**.<br>
  Example usages:
  - as a starting point of a course project (as opposed to writing everything from scratch)
  - as a case study
- The project simulates an ongoing software project for a desktop application (called _TAbby Dabby_) used for managing contact details.
  - It is **written in OOP fashion**. It provides a **reasonably well-written** code base **bigger** (around 6 KLoC) than what students usually write in beginner-level SE modules, without being overwhelmingly big.
  - It comes with a **reasonable level of user and developer documentation**.
- It is named `TAbby Dabby` because it rolls off the tongue and is designed to assist TAs (i.e. Teaching Assistants) with their administrative work.
- For the detailed documentation of this project, see the **[TAbby Dabby Product Website](https://ay2425s2-cs2103t-t12-1.github.io/tp)**.
- This project is a **part of the se-education.org** initiative. If you would like to contribute code to this project, see [se-education.org](https://se-education.org/#contributing-to-se-edu) for more info.
- Add tutorial command.
